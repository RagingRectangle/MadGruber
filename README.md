# MadGruber Bot

## About
A Discord bot used as a very basic GUI for your server along with some MAD-specific features. Examples shown below.

###### Disclaimer: This bot might look completely insane and the process it uses at times probably makes no sense but it almost always gets the damn job done, sometimes in a blaze of glory. **MADGRUBER!!!**

Join the Discord server for any help and to keep up with updates: https://discord.gg/USxvyB9QTz


**Current Features:**
- PM2 controller (start/stop/restart + current status)
- Truncate MAD quests and auto reload MAD processes
- MAD DB counter (more queries later)
- Run custom scripts with optional variables
- Quickly access URL bookmarks
- Reaction role manager
- Limit commands to only certain roles
- Options to verify certain actions first
- See current status of MAD devices (as buttons)
- Click device buttons to get basic info
- Command to check for only devices that haven't been seen lately (automated checks optional)
- Get links to recent PogoDroid versions
- RaspberryRelay integration to automatically power cycle noProto devices
- dkmur's deviceControl integration (Pause/unpause/start/quit/reboot/clear data/logcat/screenshot/power cycle)

- **pm2ResponseDeleteSeconds:** How long to wait until pm2 response is deleted (Set to 0 to never delete).

Truncate:
- **truncateVerify:** Whether or not to verify table truncate (true/false).
- **truncateOptions:** List of tables to list as options to truncate.  Can truncate multiple tables at once by combining them with '+'. Example: *["trs_quest", "pokemon", "trs_quest+pokemon"]*
- **onlyRestartBeforeTime:** Set this to limit when the bot will reload MAD instance (0-23).  If set to 0 it will always reload MADs.  If an event ends at 20:00 and you don't need to reload MAD because you won't rescan quests then enter "20".

    - Ex: `/home/mad/devicecontrol.sh`
    - Tip: If the same variables are always passed you can add them to the path.
    - Ex: `/home/mad/devicecontrol.sh poe4 cycle 20`

- **variables:** Make sure each variable is in the correct order because that is how it will be sent with the script.
    - **varDescription:** Summary of this list of variables that will be shown.  ("Pick which device" or "Choose the port").
    - **varOptions:** The list of options that this variable can be ("1", "2", "3", "4", "5").
