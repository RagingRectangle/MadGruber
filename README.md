# MadGruber Bot

## About
A Discord bot used as a very basic GUI for your server along with some MAD-specific features. Examples shown below.

###### Disclaimer: This bot might look completely incompetent and the process it uses at times probably makes no sense but it almost always gets the damn job done, sometimes in a blaze of glory. **MADGRUBER!!!**

- PM2 controller (start/stop/restart + current status)
- Truncate MAD quests and auto reload MAD processes
- MAD DB counter (more queries later)
- Run custom scripts with optional variables
- Quickly access URL bookmarks

## Config Setup
- **serverName:** Custom name for your server.
- **delaySeconds:** If used on multiple servers you can use this to make sure the bot always responds in a specific order.

Discord:
- **token:** Discord bot token.
- **prefix:** Used in front of Discord commands.
- **adminIDs:** List of Discord user IDs that can execute commands or push buttons.
- **channelIDs:** List of channel IDs that the bot will respond in. Will also respond to DMs if they are admins.
- **sendRoleMessage:** Whether or not to send role added/removed messages (true/false).
- **roleMessageDeleteSeconds:** How long to wait until role message is deleted (Set to 0 to never delete).
- **pm2Command:** Command to show the PM2 controller.
- **truncateCommand:** Command to truncate quests and restart MAD instances.
- **scriptCommand:** Command to show the list of scripts.
- **scriptVerify:** Whether or not to verify running script (true/false).
- **madQueryCommand:** Command to show MAD database queries.
- **linksCommand:** Command to show list of bookmarks.

PM2:
- **mads:** List of MAD PM2 processes that should be restarted after truncating quests.
- **ignore:** List of PM2 processes/modules to ignore if you don't want buttons for them.

madDB:
- Enter your basic MAD database info. Make sure your user has access if the database is not local.  Leave blank if you don't plan on using the truncate quest feature.
- **onlyReloadBeforeTime:** Set this to limit when the bot will reload MAD instance (0-23).  If left blank it will always reload MADs.  If an event ends at 20:00 and you don't need to reload MAD because you won't rescan quests then enter "20".

Â 
 Â 
  
## Queries Setup
- The bot is currently only able to run a simple count query to a selection of tables in the MAD database.  
- More query options will be added later.

Â 
  

## Script Setup
- Absolute paths must be used in scripts to work. Look in the scripts.example.json to get a better feel for how they work.
- **customName:** Display name
- **description:** Short summary of what it does
- **fullFilePath:** The absolute path to the file
    - Ex: `/home/mad/devicecontrol.sh`
    - Tip: If the same variables are always passed you can add them to the path
    - Ex: `/home/mad/devicecontrol.sh poe4 cycle 20`

- **variables:** Make sure each variable is in the correct order because that is how it will be sent with the script
    - **varDescription:** Summary of this list of variables that will be shown.  ("Pick which device" or "Choose the port")
    - **varOptions:** The list of options that this variable can be ("1", "2", "3", "4", "5")

Â 
 Â 

## Links Setup
- Add up to 25 links as buttons.
- Emoji field is optional. 
    - Full emoji string `<:mad:475050731032936448>`
    - Unicode form (Get correct form by escaping default emojis: `\ðŸ˜º`)


 Â 

## Roles Setup
- **messageID:** The ID of the message with the emojis users can select to add/remove roles
- **roleID:** The ID for the role that can be added/removed
- **emojiName:** The unicode emoji or the custom emoji name (only the name, NOT full emoji string)


 Â 

## Usage

- Can also use PM2 to run it instead with `pm2 start madgruber.js`

  - Press the Status button to see the current status of processes
